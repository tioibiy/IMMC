    \section{Solution}
    We calculated each the coefficient of profit of every facility on every piece of land.
    In Figure~\ref{fig:figureHeapmap}, greener colors means more suitable configuration, and redder colors means less suitable configuration.
    However, color difference between different facilities does not necessarily mean a difference in the coefficient
    of profit between facilities.
    Please see Appendix A for more information about the optimal solution.
